# wallhaven
My name is Cobus Myburgh and I am a "below" junior developer.
I have been in Infratructure for over 20 years but this is my first dig at writing code.

This is a simple script to download wallpapers from Wallhaven using Python

Settings can be found here https://wallhaven.cc/help/api

Please use your own API by creating a file called api.key in the same directory as the script.
The file should only include your APi key
